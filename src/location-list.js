        clue: '"Don\'t get me wrong, I like a good game," the pencil-thin man says, "but you\'ve gotten carried away with your questions. It\'ll be in bad taste to keep pestering folks here. Though I did see someone earlier - I\'m drawing a blank on his face, but he was scratching on a napkin and had this run-of-the-mill smell of sandalwood. Must\'ve just had a shave."',
        title: 'Joe\'s Bar',
        description: 'Out of the blue, you find yourself at Joe\'s Bar. You\'ve been here before - it\'s par for the course for a detective like you. The place is owned by Joe, a crooked ex-cop who crossed the line one too many times. When you arrive, there are just a few sad regulars - a little overkill on the drinking if you ask me. You get butterflies in my stomach as you approach Joe, who pretends to clean glasses. "You still running games downstairs?" He stares blankly. "The cat\'s out of the bag," you say with a knowing look. Down in the basement, you find your mark.',

        clue: '"Mark my words," the barber hacks with a smoker\'s laugh, "that hoity-toity customer with the glass eye is trouble. He\'s always bragging about wining and dining half the town, says his view of the city seals every deal. Keeping quiet during his shave? Well, that\'s easier said than done!"',
        title: 'Mane Street Barbers',
        description: 'You can smell the sandalwood from the street. This must be the place the pencil-thin man was yapping about. Unfortunately it looks like it\'s closed. Fortunately you see a balding barber inside crouched over a newspaper playing the crosswords. After knocking on the door the barber greets you, "Get lost, chum! We\'re closed!" He turns to return to his rag. Keeping your composure you holler through the door, "Let me help you with that puzzle, friend." The barber halts in his tracks, "What\'s it to you, chum?" You clear your throat, "Just need some particulars on one of your customers." He opens up the door. "Well, I hope you aren\'t as dumb as you look. I\'ve got one word left, but it\'s got me flummoxed."',

        clue: '"I\'m toast if he comes back!" the voice wimpers. "Around here, it just isn\'t done to call the police. But I have a good intuitive sense about you - you can help. The lock combination - I\'ve heard him mutter it: two, three, five... you\'ll need to figure out the fourth number!"',
        title: 'The Fibonacci Building',
        description: 'The doorman shows you to the private elevator when you announce you are an ophthalmologist personally delivering an ocular prosthesis. The elevator door opens and your eyes can barely take in the palatial, immaculate suite. The bar is fully-stocked. As you waltz towards the liquor a shout emanates from a corner room, "You loaf! Let me out!" "I\'m no loaf - I\'m a stout cookie," you reply. "Who\'s there?" the voice wimpers. You move towards the door, "I\'m here to help." You try the handle but it\'s locked with a strange contraption. "You\'re not him, but he\'ll be here soon. I\'ve heard him mutter the first three numbers under his breath: two, three, and five. You\'re gonna have to guess the fourth. Quickly, get it open before he gets back!"',
